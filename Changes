1.008
  -- No longer in the Alpha Stage, now considerd developed
  -- Pod changes most of the pod change are complete
  -- added more examples

  -- added the layer cake example and modules
   -- Bug fix/Major change to internals for Compare
     -- get_next no longer makes calls to has_next
       This caused a race contition when sub classing the the compare interface.
  -- Added major documentation improvements, 
    what this package does should now be very clear ( I hope )
  -- Added to_string operator for Compare Result object

2.010
  -- Documentaion clean up.. still trying to explain things, more pod clean ups to come.

2.011 More pod clean ups.. more to come I'm sure.

2.012 More pod changes, should make sense now.. had a bunch of people review the docs and give input.

2.013 Cleaned up a long standing oops in the CookBook

2.014 
  -- added missing example MyIterator.pm in the examples folder...

2.015
  -- Fixed prototype missmatch warning showing in tests versions of perl 5.6.2

2.016
  -- Pod fix ups
  -- Added 2 file iterator interfaces taken from the example folder as a base starting point
    1. Consolidator
    2. Iterator

2.017
  -- More pod fix ups.. more to come
  -- updated Data-Range-Compare-Stream-Sort.t  the code wasn't broken the tests were..
   perl versions prior to 5.8 used quick sort: The unit tests have been updated to reflect this.

2.018
  -- Updated some examples
  -- More pod fixups
  -- Added new Consolidate class
    The new class dynamically adds columns to the iterator object based on column overlaps!
  -- Added new Compare package
  -- Added new support classe(s)
  -- added new result sub classe(s)
  -- Most classes and pods have been extended and or updated, no compatibility changes, just added alot of what was missing

2.019
  -- More pod Fopas cleaned up.
  -- bug fix: AdjacentAsc.pm did not call on_consolidate, this has been fixed

2.020
  -- More pod clean ups..
    SOME OME SAVE ME FROM THIS MONSTER KNOWN AS DOCUMENTATION!!!!  It feeds on my time, so much time!
  -- Bug fix: implemented the column id related interfaces in Compare::Base.pm
  -- Added a true LayerCake example in the examples folder.
     -- Will make cookbook pod in a future release explaining it.

3.021
  -- added callback Data::Range::Compare::Stream* to support knowing when a range has been generated
  -- Changed the constructor arguments Compare/Result.pm
  -- added ColumnRelations Features to Compare/Result.pm
  -- Added several optimizations to the Comapre::Asc that should help when dealing with large numbers of columns
  -- Resovled race condition preventing root_id from being set in iterators when columns were auto generated
  -- Consolidate objects no longer support set_root_column_id
  -- Added a consolidator->consolidator fill missnig class
  -- Added support to Compare/Asc.pm to allow for deletion of iterator objects.
  -- created new result base class
  -- updated iterator base classes and pods
  -- ColumnRelations.pm has been removed!
  -- Consolidate/Result.pm has 2 new is_missing is_generated along with an updated set of constructor arguments
  -- Add generated state for existing consolidator objects!

3.022
  -- all Consolidate iterators have been updated to allow any iterator as their argument
  -- added autosort option to Iterator/Array.pm
  -- Stream.pod More updates
  -- FillMissing.pod updated
  -- Sort.pod updated
  -- So it seems Test::More has had some major changes made to it....
    most of the tests had to be updated to work around this.
