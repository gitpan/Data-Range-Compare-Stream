Data-Range-Compare-Stream 
======================================

This module is intended to get past the horizontal scaling limits of Data::Range::Compare.
Although similar to Data::Range::Compare, the module itself is complete depature in both design
and implementation.

Take a look at the perl scripts in the "examples" folder to get a good idea of how to use and
extend this module for your own needs.

INSTALLATION

Before you upgrade to version 3.x or 4.x.

Changes that may break your code between version 2.020 and 3.021 and up.

1. Data::Range::Compare::Stream::Iterator::Compare::ColumnRelations has been remoevd!
   The features have been moved into Data::Range::Compare::Stream::Iterator::Compare::Result

2. Iterator objects no longer support $iterator->set_root_column_id($id);

3. Data::Range::Compare::Stream::Iterator::Consolidate::OverlapAsColumn had a race condition that prevented 
  root column_ids from being set, this has been resovled.

4. Generic factory constructors have been added as of 4.x.
  a. All iterator classes and subclasses support the factory_instance=>$obj argument.
  b. All range objects now support $range->factory($start,$end,$data);
  c. A generic callback OO range class has been added see:  Data::Range::Compare::Stream::CallBack 
    c.1 when using  Data::Range::Compare::Stream::CallBack, make sure to set the factory_instance=>$obj 
      in any iterator you create!
