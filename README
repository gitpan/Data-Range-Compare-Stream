Data-Range-Compare-Stream 
======================================

This module is intended to get past the horizontal scaling limits of Data::Range::Compare.
Although similar to Data::Range::Compare, the module itself is complete depature in both design
and implementation.

Take a look at the perl scripts in the "examples" folder to get a good idea of how to use and
extend this module for your own needs.
