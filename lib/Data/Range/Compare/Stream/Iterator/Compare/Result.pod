=head1 NAME

Data::Range::Compare::Stream::Iterator::Compare::Result - Range Compare Result Object

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a result object for classes that implement:

Data::Range::Compare::Stream::Iterator::Compare::Asc

=head2 OO Methods

=over 3

=item * my $result=new Data::Range::Compare::Stream::Iterator::Compare::Result (COMMON_RANGE,[OVERLAP_RESULTS],[OVERLAP_IDS],[NON_OVERLAP_IDS]);

  Object constructor:

    All arguments are mandatory

      COMMON_RANGE

        Implements Data::Range::Compare::Stream

      OVERLAP_RESULTS
        
	An array ref with any of the following objects

	  Data::Range::Compare::Stream::Consolidate::Result

	  Data::Range::Compare::Stream::Compare::Result

	  undef
    
    OVERLAP_IDS
    
      An array ref representing the ids in OVERLAP_RESULTS that are not undef

    NON_OVERLAP_IDS

      An array ref represetnig the ids of OVERLAP_RESULTS that are undef

=item * my $range=$result->get_common

  Returns the common range.

=item * my $range=$result->get_common_range

  Alias to $result->get_common

=item * my $count=$result->get_overlap_count;

  Returns the number of elements in OVERLAP_RESULTS that matched the common range

=item * my $string=$result->to_string;

  Returns a string representing the result

=item * my $count=$result->get_column_count;

  Returns the number of columns that are in OVERLAP_RESULTS

=item * my $ref=$result->get_overlap_ids;

  Returns an array ref of column ids that overlap with the column range

=item * my $ref=$result->get_non_overlap_ids;

  Returns an array ref of column ids that do not overlap with the column range

=item * my $count=$result->get_non_overlap_count;

  Returns the number of columns that did not overlap with the common range

=item * my $range=$result->get_consolidator_result_by_id($id);

  $id represents the column

  $range will be undef if the column did not overlap with the common range
  
    or

  $range will be an object that implements Daa::Range::Compare::Stream

=item * my $range=$result->get_result_by_id($id);

  alias to get_consolidator_result_by_id

=item * my $boolean=$result->is_empty;

  $boolean is true when no ranges overlapped with the common range

=item * my $boolean=$result->none_overlap;

  alias to is_empty

=item * my $boolean=$result->is_full;

  $boolean is true when all OVERLAP_RESULTS overlapped with the common range

=item * my $ref=$result->get_overlapping_containers;

  Returns an array ref of each object that overlapped with the common range

=item * my $ref=$result->get_all_containers;

  Returns an array ref of OVERLAP_RESULTS

=item * my $ref=$result->get_non_overlapping_containers;

  Returns an array ref of undef for every column that did not overlap
